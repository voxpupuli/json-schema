The Ruby JSON Schema library is meant to be a community effort, and as such, there are no strict guidelines for contributing.

All individuals that have a pull request merged will receive collaborator access to the repository. Due to the restrictions on RubyGems authentication, permissions to release a gem must be requested along with the email desired to be associated with the release credentials.

Accepting changes to the JSON Schema library shall be made through the use of pull requests on GitHub. A pull request must receive at least two (2) "+1" comments from current contributors to the JSON Schema library before being accepted and merged. If a breaking issue and fix exists, please feel free to contact the project maintainer at hoxworth@gmail.com or @hoxworth for faster resolution.

Releases follow semantic versioning and may be made at a maintainer's discretion.
